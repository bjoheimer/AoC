# AoC
My Solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), for now with Python, aber schau'n wir mal, was wird ... was wird 

The input files cannot be distributed here due to copyright.
However, if you want to solve advent of code using the original input, just download the inputs from the official AoC website and save them in the same directory as the corresponsing python script `AoC<XX>/<x>.py` (with the year 20XX) under the name:
```
input<x>_1.txt
```
and replace <x> by the number of the day.
